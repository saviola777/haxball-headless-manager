## Version 0.9.0

- ditch GUI, [haxroomie-web](https://github.com/morko/haxroomie-web) does a
  better job of it
- adjust default configurations to support haxroomie
- remove dryRun, trueHeadless, sendChatMaxLength from config
- start organising documentation (still useless, sorry!)
- revert back to old approach where plugins are only loaded after the room link
  is available. This makes everything easier, so deal with the minimal delay!
- fix problems with injected destructuring parameters
- remove custom event `onLoad`, please use `onRoomLink` for initialization
- when loading plugins by code, a name can now be passed along
- fix problem where plugin names were not picked up from the pluginSpec
- add event system for HHM-related events (plugin loaded/enabled/disabled)
- `_postInit` plugin is now called `_user/postInit`
- add custom event handlers `onEnable` and `onDisable`

## Version 0.8.1

- fix npm dependencies to automatically install from github repositories where
  necessary (thanks [morko](https://github.com/morko))
- `haxroomie-RoomTrapper` is renamed to haxball-room-trapper and we are back to
  using the repository of the original author (thanks
  [morko](https://github.com/morko))
- add config file for testing during development
- the plugin system now loads plugins as soon as possible and does not wait for
  the room link anymore. This means if you expecting the room to be running in
  your `onLoad` handler, this code has to be moved into the `onRoomLink` handler!
- add event system for HHM changes like plugins being added / disabled, which
  can also be used from within plugins

## Version 0.8.0

- add support for event state validators and pre-event handler hooks, which help
  deal with problematic multi-handler situations
- add room.log() function, which automatically adds the plugin name in log
  messages
- extra parameters (event handler execution metadata) are now passed more
  smartly by analysing the expected parameters of an event handler using
  reflection
- add room extension mechanism which allows extending existing room function or
  adding new ones using room.extend()
- plugins have been moved to a [separate repository](https://github.com/saviola777/hhm-plugins)
- refactoring!

## Version 0.7.3

- add support for iterable (e.g. array) or object handlers
- add [CORS Anywhere](https://github.com/Rob--W/cors-anywhere) proxy through
  which all AJAX requests are automatically proxied (thanks
  [morko](https://github.com/morko))
- add `HHM.log.toRoom()`, which allows logging to both the room and the console
- fix problem where plugins where sometimes loaded twice

## Version 0.7.2

- refactor room and plugin manager interfaces to be more intuitive and clear
- add custom event `onLoad` to give plugins a way to execute code once
  all dependencies have been loaded

  messages up to a maximum length defined in `HHM.config.sendChatMaxLength`
